# Weather-Dashboard

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a one page project allowing the user to search for the current weather and the 5 Day Forecast in any city. There was to be a search bar along with a list of previously searched locations saved to local storage. There needed to be a section including the current date, weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index as well as defining the UV index by color depending on intensity. The five day forecast needed to contain the weather, temperature, and humidity as well as the date. There was no starter/demo code given for this assignment.
